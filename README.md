Natalie - Storyboard Code Generator (for Swift)

## Synopsis
Script generate Swift code based on storyboard files to make work with Storyboards and segues easier. Generated file **reduce usage of Strings** as identifiers for Segues or Storyboards.

###Enumerate Storyboards
Generated enum Storyboards with convenient interface (drop-in replacement for UIStoryboard).

```swift
enum Storyboards: String {
    case Main = "Main"
    case Second = "Second"
    ...
```

Instantiate ViewController for storyboard
```swift
let vc:MyViewController = Storyboards.Main.instantiateInitialViewController()
```

example usage for prepareForSegue()

```swift
override func prepareForSegue(segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: AnyObject?) {
    if let selection = segue.selection() {
        switch (selection, segue.destinationViewController) {
        case (MainViewController.Segue.ScreenOneSegue, let oneViewController as ScreenOneViewController):
            oneViewController.view.backgroundColor = UIColor.yellowColor()
        default: break
        }
    }
}
```

###Segues

Perform segue
```swift
self.performSegue(MyCustomViewController.Segue.goToDetails, sender:nil)
```

Each custom view controller is extended with this code and provide list of available segues and additional informations from Storyboard.

`storyboardIdentifier` is unique identifier of view controller in Storyboard

`Segue` enumeration contains list of available segues

`kind` property represent types Segue

`destination` property return type of destinated view controller.

```swift
extension MyCustomViewController { 
    var storyboardIdentifier:String { return "oEB-rK-hJd" }

    enum Segue: String, Printable {
        case goToDetails = "goToDetails"
        case expandGroup = "composeMessage"

        var kind: SegueKind? {
            ...
        }

        var destination: UIViewController.Type? {
            ...
        }

        var identifier: String { return self.description } 
        var description: String { return self.rawValue }
    }
}
```

##Installation

There is no need to install anything.

Simply download `natalie.swift` file and use it.

It is possible to integrate Natalie with Xcode using this **Run Script**

```
echo "Natalie generator"
/usr/local/bin/natalie.swift "$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME" > "$PROJECT_DIR/$PROJECT_NAME/Storyboards.swift"
```
don't forget to add generated `Storyboards.swift` to the project.

##Usage:

Generate file for single storyboard
```
$ natalie.swift Main.storyboard > Storyboards.swift
```

Generate file for any storyboard file found at given path

```
$ natalie.swift path/toproject > Storyboards.swift
```
